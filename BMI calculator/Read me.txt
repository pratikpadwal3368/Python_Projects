The body mass index (BMI) is a measure to see if someone is underweight or overweight.

This is the formula used to calculate it:
bmi is equal to the person's weight (Kg) divided by the person's height (Meter) squared.

The resulting number indicates one of the following categories:
Underweight = less than 18
Normal = more or equal to 18 and less than 25
Overweight = more or equal to 25 and less than 30
Obesity = 30 or more
